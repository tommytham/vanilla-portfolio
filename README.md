*still need to implement a couple more small interactive fun things & make it mobile friendly*

# About

My portfolio website that will include a bit about me and a few little JavaScript fun things!

# Technologies 

I will be using strictly only HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this.

# Goal

To gain a greater understanding of vanilla JavaScript so that I can transition into a framework such as React or Angular.
